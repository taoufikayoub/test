# Fibonacci Calculator and Unit Testing

## Overview
This project contains a Python script to calculate the Fibonacci sequence and unit tests to verify its correctness.

## Project Structure
- **fibonacci.py**: Contains the implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.
- **fibonacci_test.py**: Contains the unit tests for the Fibonacci sequence.
- **main.py**: Runs all the unit tests.

## Files
### fibonacci.py
This file contains the following function:
- `fibonacci(n)`: Returns the nth Fibonacci number.

### fibonacci_test.py
This file contains unit tests using the `unittest` framework to verify the correctness of the `fibonacci` function.

### main.py
This file is the entry point to run all unit tests.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Run the following command to execute the unit tests:
